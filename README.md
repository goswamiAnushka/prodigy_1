# Responsive Landing Page with Navbar

## Overview

This project is part of an internship task assigned by Prodigy InfoTech. The task involves creating a responsive landing page that includes a navigation bar (navbar) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navbar should have toggle functionality for mobile responsiveness and hover effects for improved user interaction.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.
- **Navigation Bar**: The navbar includes links that navigate to different sections of the landing page. It also has a toggle button for mobile devices.
- **Toggle Functionality**: On smaller screens, the navbar links are hidden by default and can be toggled using the hamburger menu button.
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth color transition effects are applied to the navbar links when hovered over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the structure of the landing page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the landing page, including the navbar, layout, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity to the navbar, such as toggle functionality and hover effects.
